# CMake helper reference
This file documents the main CMake workflow for the project:

1. Configure the project by running:
   ```
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```
2. Build the executable:
   ```
   cmake --build build
   ```
3. Run the demo (assuming Debug configuration on Windows):
   ```
   build/bin/Debug/dataviz-uit.exe
   ```

The application also sets `QTFRAMEWORK_BYPASS_LICENSE_CHECK=1` internally so the Qt license service check does not prevent startup on machines without the separate service.
