## ?? CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Mock Data Strategy ?
```
Week 1: C2V Dev 1 creates mock DataStructureInfo
       ?? C2V Dev 2 uses immediately (Week 2)

Week 2: C2V creates mock VisualizationState
?? UI team uses immediately (Week 3)

Week 3: Real implementations ready
       ?? Swap in seamlessly, no blocker
```

### 2. Interface Contracts ?
```
Week 1: All interfaces defined & agreed
Week 2: Implementation can proceed independently
Week 3: Integration happens naturally
```

### 3. Continuous Integration ?
```
Daily:  Each team merges to team branch
Weekly: Team branches merge to main
Result: Conflict detection within 24 hours
```

### 4. Clear Communication ?
```
Daily:  15-min standup (if parallel work)
Weekly: 30-min full sync (Friday 2 PM)
Result: Transparent coordination
```
