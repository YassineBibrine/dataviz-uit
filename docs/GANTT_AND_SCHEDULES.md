## ?? Expected Outcomes

### From Parallelization Strategy:
```
? Team productivity increased 40-60%
   (in parallel development weeks)

? Quality improved through:
   - Parallel testing
   - Concurrent code review
   - Continuous integration

? Risk reduced through:
   - Early integration testing
   - Distributed workload
   - Multiple review cycles

? Schedule maintained at:
   - 8 weeks total (critical path)
   - But with better quality
   - And team morale higher
```
