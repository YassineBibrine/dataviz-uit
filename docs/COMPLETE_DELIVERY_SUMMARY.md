## ?? KEY FINDINGS: PARALLELIZATION

### Critical Path Remains: 8 Weeks
```
Week 1-3: C2V Development (sequential)
Week 4-8:   UI + V2C + Testing (parallel)
```

### Maximum Parallelization: Weeks 4-5
```
TRACK 1: UI Dev 1 (GraphWidget + Animation)
TRACK 2: UI Dev 2 (MainWindow + Controls)
TRACK 3: V2C Dev 1 (Code Generation)
TRACK 4: V2C Dev 2 (Source Rewriting)

NO DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN ANY TRACKS ???
4 COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT PARALLEL WORK STREAMS
```

### Parallelization by Phase
```
Week 1:     1 track (C2V Dev 1)
Week 2-3: 2-3 tracks (C2V Dev 1+2, UI/V2C prep)
Week 4-5:   4 tracks (MAXIMUM - UI + V2C parallel)
Week 6-7:   3 streams (Features + Testing + Documentation)
Week 8:     3 streams (Build + QA + Release)
```
